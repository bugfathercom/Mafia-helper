<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](bugfather.com/free-courses/mafia-screenshot.png)

There are lot of greate mafia shows on youtube, but there is always a catch: THEY SPOIL THE ROLES! 
but some people don't want that and this little project can help them!

Here's why:
* You can use this app to cover any part of video that is spoiling sth.
* You can use this app to black out the screen temporarily so you can do your other thins on the computer while it's blocking the mafia's night.
* You can mute and umute the system (I know this sound kinda lame but you will appreciate it when some player's voice starts playing and you have about one second to mute the system :D :smile:

Of course, no application will serve all video editing styles since their methods may be different. So I'm making it open-source just to show you a neat flexible way around those spoiling editions that they can further extend.
